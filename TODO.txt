Fix Heatmap code (important)
Fix shitty implementation of saving photos[Show what class the detected picture falls into](optional but important)
Make GUI(extremely important)
general spaghetti code fixes
Implement cloud integration

For seriallogger.py:
1)[DONE] add a check to check if there is already headings, and if there is, don't print the board id
temperature, and all that. just keeo appending the values.
2)[DONE BUT UNTESTED] also make sure tat empty values don't get added.

For espcamphotosaver.py:
1) Save the photos with the actual class itself in the name rather than healthy or unhealthy.
2) the way i wrote the photo saving code is crap. it works but its crap. make it better or something idk.(optional).

For Heatmap.py:
1)[DONE BUT GUI NEEDS WORK] Integrate with your GUI. Make it so the graphs display on the app window instead of separately.

For Cloud Integration:
lol that's not happening in 9 hours good luck.
